## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey! I'm Li Zhou, an NLP enthusiast and explorerðŸ¤—. 

I'm currently a Postdoc research fellow at [CUHK-Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), working with [Prof. Haizhou Li](https://colips.org/~eleliha/). I received my PhD degree from [UESTC](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) in June 2024, supervised by Prof. [Wenyu Chen](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenyu-Chen-10).
During my PhD journey, I visited the [CoAStaL](https://coastalcph.github.io/) NLP group in the University of Copenhagen (2022-2023), supervised by Prof. [Daniel Hershcovich](https://danielhers.github.io/) and working with the rest of the team.

My recent research focuses on speech-language models, including emotionally intelligent dialogue systems and controllable generation.
Besides, I am also interested in human-centered NLP, cultural consideration in NLP, LLM bias, AI Safety, and semantic representation learning.



I enjoy taking on new challenges in NLP. 
It allows me to learn, grow, and enhance my research abilities. 
I also love working with different researchers to spark creativity and new perspectives. 

If you find my research intriguing or if it fits your project's needs, 
please feel free to reach out to me.
